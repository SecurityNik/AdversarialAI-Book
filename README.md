Over the past few months, I have been working on expanding my knowledge on Adversarial AI. Rather than putting together a bunch of [blogs posts](www.securitynik.com) , I decided to consolidate everything into one book.  

Along with this book, there are going to be about 30 or more labs, focuses on Adversarial AI. These labs will be released via Jupyter Notebooks, that will be hosted at my [GitHub repo dedicated to this book](github.com/SecurityNik/AdversarialAI-Book). 

This book is designed to be as much as possible self-contained. Nonetheless, the following background is important for readers to get the most out of this book and its associated Jupyter Notebooks. An intermediate knowledge and understanding of python. If you have already dabbled with building machine learning models and or have written a few scripts to solve your automation tasks, then you should be good to go.

Alternatively, if you have not done any prior work with building machine learning models, my series on [Beginning Machine and Deep Learning with Zeek logs](https://www.securitynik.com/2023/05/beginning-machine-and-deep-learning.html) is a good place to start. There is a lot of content there to get you up to speed relatively fast.


With that said, Iâ€™ve made every effort to add the necessary comments to the code, so that we are all clear on what the code is doing. 

Look out! It's going to be a great learning journey for all of us!
